# TanukiBox Code of Conduct

## 1. Introduction
This document establishes a code of conduct based on the principles of free software, inspired by the [GNU Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html). Our community values freedom, cooperation, and inclusion, and we promote mutual respect among all participants.

## 2. Principles of Conduct

Our community is based on the following fundamental principles:

- **Respect for others**: All participants are expected to interact with courtesy and consideration.
- **Freedom of expression and diversity of thought**: We value diverse opinions as long as they are expressed respectfully.
- **Cooperation and mutual learning**: Open collaboration and knowledge sharing are encouraged.
- **No universal behavioral model**: There is no strict set of rules regarding behavior, but interactions should take place within a framework of respect and cordiality.

## 3. Software Principles

The development and contribution of software within this community follow the principles established in the [GNU Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html), which include:

- **Freedom to use**: All developed software must be available for use for any purpose.
- **Access to source code**: Users are guaranteed the right to study and modify software.
- **Freedom to share**: The distribution of software copies is allowed and encouraged.
- **Collaboration on improvements**: Any improvements should be shared with the community for collective benefit.

## 4. Community Participation

All members are encouraged to actively participate in discussions, share knowledge, and contribute to the development of free software. The community operates on a principle of **good faith**, trusting that all act in the best interest of the common good.

## 5. Conflict Resolution

In case of disagreements or conflicts, mediation based on open and respectful dialogue is recommended. No formal sanctioning system will be implemented; instead, any issues should be resolved through communication and cooperation.

This code of conduct seeks to balance individual freedom with mutual respect, promoting an environment where everyone can contribute and learn without unnecessary restrictions. Our guiding philosophy is **free software**, and our fundamental rule is consideration for others.
