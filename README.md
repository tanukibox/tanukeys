Service for storing public keys of users for various purposes such as message signature verification, encrypting information for a specific user, storing cryptocurrency wallet addresses, and simplifying key exchanges between devices. The service also supports post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for future-proofing.  

Tanukeys is designed as a **federated system**, allowing instances to interoperate by retrieving and verifying public keys from other Tanukeys instances. This enables seamless key sharing, automatic updates through instance subscriptions, and a decentralized trust model for enhanced security and reliability.  



## Features

- [ ] **Public Key Storage**: Store public keys associated with individual users or devices.
- [ ] **Message Signature Verification**: Retrieve stored public keys to verify signed messages.
- [ ] **Data Encryption**: Use the stored public keys to encrypt data intended for a specific user.
- [ ] **Cryptocurrency Wallets**: Manage public keys for various cryptocurrency wallets.
- [ ] **Post-Quantum Cryptography Support**: Includes the ability to store keys for post-quantum algorithms, ensuring long-term security.
- [ ] **Federated Key Retrieval**: Support importing and verifying public keys from external Tanukeys instances, enabling interoperability across federated networks.
- [ ] **Federated Subscription System**: Enable instances to subscribe to other Tanukeys instances to automatically sync and update public keys as they change.
- [ ] **Signed Subkeys**: Allow users to create signed subkeys that reference a master key, ensuring hierarchical key management.


## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Developed using Rust.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persisting public keys and user information.
